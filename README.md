#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

software engineering is the design,development,testing and maintainance of software applications.
It is important by enabling the creation of various software applications and systems.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

 1.The development of programming languages
    programming languages were developed to empasize, the use of clear control structures and improve code readability and maintainace
    
 2.The advent of structured programming in the 1970s
    This established a linear approach to software development which became standard for large scale projects
    
 3.The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.
    promoted development, collaboration and flexibility inresponse to changing project requirements

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
   
  1 Requirements
  Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
  2 Design
  Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface and data flow based on gathered requirements
  3 Implementation
  Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
  4 Testing
  Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
  5 Deployment
  Releasing the software to users or customers.
  6 Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

 Waterfall is Sequential approach with distinct phases like requirements and design flowing down as a waterfall do.
 Agile is Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

 1.Software Developer
 Designing and implementing software solutions based on requirements.
 Writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code.
 Conducting unit testing to ensure code quality.
 2.Quality Assurance Engineer
 Developing test plans and test cases based on requirements.
 Executing test cases and reporting defects.
 Performing various types of testing such as unit, integration testing system testing and acceptance testing
 Analyzing test results and providing feedback to the development team
 3.Project Manager
 Defining project scope and objectives.
 Developing project plans and timelines.
 Managing project resources such as budget, personnel and equipment.
 Monitoring project progress and addressing risks
 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
   Integrated Development Environments provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code like Visual Studio.
   Version Control Systems aid in tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members like GIT

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
   1.Changing Requirements
     ensure you have clear project definition, change management process before implimentation
   2.Tight Deadlines
   prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.
   3.Lack of effective communication and collaboration
    the members should have regular team meetings and establish clear communication channels

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
 1. Unit testing
     involves testing individual components  of a software application
    their importance is to make sure that they validate each unit to work as expected by ensuring early bug detection
    therefore ensuring code quality
2.intergration testing
  It focus on the interactions between different software components or modules.
  It is important in detecting user interface issues and ensure data flow and communications between components
3.system testing
it involves testing the complete software application system
Evaluates the system's performance, usability, and reliability,Identifies defects that may not be apparent at lower testing levels and
Ensures the system meets end-user needs.
4.Acceptance testing
the software is evaluated against the requirements and criteria set by the end-user or client.
Builds confidence in the system's readiness for deployment,Validates the system against business objectives and
Reduces the risk of user dissatisfaction.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of crafting effective prompts or instructions to guide an AI model's response
1 .It ensures accuracy ,clear and specific prompt reduces ambiguity and increases the likelihood of getting the desired results
2.Efficiency a well-structured prompt can provide the necessary context, reducing the need for multiple iterations. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague
"write for me a poem"
improved
"write for me a short poem with 3 stanzas about a girl who regrets choosing a bad company of friends ,the tone should be sad and regretfull"
The improved prompt is clear because it outlines the specific task poem that the AI is to write about
